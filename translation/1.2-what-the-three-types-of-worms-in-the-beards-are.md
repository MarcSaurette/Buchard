# 1.2 What the three types of worms in the beards are

## What the three types of worms in the beards are and by what unguent, that is, by which virtues, they are purged. Chapter Two.

Furthermore, you yourselves should know that clean beards ought to be protected from three kinds of worms. Because, unless what presently is pathetic and fearful in dread was regarded diligently, many-footed bugs and most filthy troops of lice and that third kind which is said to take a name for itself from the feet on the eye are known to bubble from the interior. Morever, this is diligently guarded against in exterior beards when interior beards are maintained clean and sound. And from where does it come about unless through that unguent which descends on the beard, the beard of Aaron? The aforementioned worms are not able to arise in beards which are oiled with such unguent as following the example of the beard of Aaron. This unguent descends onto interior beards, where exists the charity of a pure heart, good conscience and unfeigned faith. Notice how this unguent destroys the three types of worms by the power of its threefold division, such that beards might be clean and sound. Purity of the heart consumes and destroys in everyway lentipedes, as goodness of conscience does to troops of lendiums and as the truth of faith does to that third kind which assumes its name from the feet on the eye.
