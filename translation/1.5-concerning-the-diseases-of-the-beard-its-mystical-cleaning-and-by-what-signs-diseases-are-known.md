## Concerning the diseases of the beard, its mystical cleaning and by what signs diseases are known

Furthermore, this unguent is not only necessary against the aforementioned filthy things, but also against the lepram which are accustomed to occupy beards. If you do not believe me, ask Moses, or rather, the Lord in Moses. We excerpt from these things which are said thence what pertains to you brothers. “In his beard”, it says, “the lepra grew, the priest saw him.” He has lepram in his beard who on account of the fact that he seems wise to himself or casts uprightness from his courage, since wisdom and courage, decourousness and virtue are signified in a beard, and that priest who undertakes the care of souls, maintains and strives to keep the beard clean from lepra. He who again, slips into heresy or blasphemy on account of his wisdom is known to have contracted a lepram in his beard. However, a sign of proof is given there, so that the lepra of the head and beard is known to exist, since it is said, “and if indeed if the skin has shrunk and the hair is gone yellow and thin, he shall pronounce him unclean,” namely the priest, “since there is a lepra of the head and beard.” That is to say: if the intention of thought abandoned a particular position to evil and it ought to be investigated more wisely, it is condemned. For just as a lepra in the hair is an error in cognition, thus a lepra in a wise beard is a searching towards evil, according to that statement, “they are skilled in doing evil.” On the other hand, signs are reported truly by which it is proven that a lepra of hairs or beards ought not to be, since thither it is enjoined: “But if he finds the skin level and the hair still dark, they must be shut away for a week, and if he finds that the disfigurement has not spread and the hair keeps its colour and the skin is level, the hair must be shaved all round the infected part. For a week more they must be shut away, and if then he finds the infection is confined to the same spot, and there is no shrinking, he will declare them clean and they will be free from defilement when their clothes have been washed." Every line of this passage demonstrates figuratively the state of cognition in the hairs and of wisdom in the beard, namely that it will be known \(with the spirit of the seventhform teaching\) either that not many leave from the footpath of truth \(when the error is minor\) and the accustomed grace remains in the hairs and the beard or if also many filthily deviate from the truth, the beard is born to confusion and the hairs pay over condemnation on the heads, that is that both in the hairs and in the beard it has a most filthy lepram. If it remains in its filthiness of which, just as is announced below, it ought to be considered for complete burning \( if truly it is discerned that the cleanliness of mendacity is repaired and both the hair and the beard is dedicated to razoring and washing, so that both new hairs and a new beard might grow back\). You also, bearded brother, if glorying from the antiquity of your age or the long life of religion, despise your juniors and insult them, prefering your antiquity to their recentness, should go and show yourself to a priest since you have a lepram in your beard.
