## The moral signification why the beard of Aaron is mentioned with a double emphasis. Chapter Four.

But why the beard of one person, which amounts to a single beard, is repeated thus as it is said, “on the beard, the beard” unless since the mystery of the beard of one is transferred to multiple beards? And just as from the imitation of one of the bearded conversi, many bearded conversi are constituted, thus the mystery of one beard related to the many is honoured and through this \[mystery\] the conversi should know why they ought to be bearded, when unhesitatingly it is noted by them which bearded one they ought to imitate for having beard. Beloved brothers, you beards are cleansed also by the unction of unguent, just as the beard of him is cleansed throught the unguent which descends on his beard.
